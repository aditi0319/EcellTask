        <p class="about-text">
          Event Planner Ltd is an event logistics and marketing company which
          was formed back in 2013. The company offers A-Z event planning
          services from a team of experienced and energetic event planners,
          suppliers, venues and more. One of the main reasons behind the success
          of Event Planner is the fact that the team does not charge fees to its
          clients! With the number of events we organise, Event Planner Ltd does
          not need to add exorbitant fees and mark-ups to make its profit
          margins. This ensures that our clients list, which is constantly
          growing, make regular use of our services.

        <p class="about-text">
          The Event Planner team does not charge any fees to its clients*. Yes,
          this might sound strange. However, the company earns its profits
          through its suppliers, with whom a very strong relationship has been
          built. This does not mean that the costs are up-marked to make up for
          the fee. On the contrary, they are less than it would cost a company
          when booking directly. We know it sounds too good to believe, but over
          the years this formula has helped the Event Planner team become the
          success story they are today. This has not in any way reduced the
          level of professionalism with which the services are carried, as shown
          by the large number of local and international clients, who work with
          us on a regular basis. In a nutshell, you pay no fee, pay your
          supplier less and have a professional team handling all your loose
          ends. Sounds too good, but it is true! You can check out our clients
          as testimonials

        <p style="color:#bb537d;font-size: 1.5rem;" >The Team</p>
        <p class="about-text">
          The Event Planner team is made up of a mix of people. James and Ilona
          take care of corporate events. Josette is the wedding guru. Nicole is
          the creative one. Sergio is the merchandise expert. In addition to
          this group of people, a large support team helps out in everything the
          company does, in office work to on-site logistics planning. One thing
          we can truly say about our team is that we are very passionate about
          our job!
